# Simple MariaDB database server configuration file.
#
# =================================================================
# Base configuration courtesy of Open Query (http://openquery.com/)
# For production use, case-specific preparation is still required.
# 2009-10-07
#
# This is *not* an optimised config, merely a more sane baseline:
# - binary and slow log enabled, with enhancements
# - InnoDB default (e.g., ACID out-of-the-box, same as on Windows)
# - strict mode (for proper input checks, same as on Windows)
# - various other useful settings
# - make use of MariaDB/Percona/OurDelta enhancements/extensions
#
# For tuning assistance, please see http://openquery.com/services
