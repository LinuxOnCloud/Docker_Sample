metadata:
  name: cattle-nfs  # socket file = nfs and the name of control loop is 'workers'

options:
  # This expression is a template used to select the key from each source entry
  # of instance.Description.  Note here we escape the template tags
  # so that template expressions don't get clobbered by infrakit template when
  # using that as a preprocessor prior to committing.

  # How often to run the sync.  The string value here is in the format of Go's time.Duration.
